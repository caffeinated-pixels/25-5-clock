# 25 + 5 clock

My React-based app for the [Build a 25 + 5 Clock](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-25--5-clock) freeCodeCamp project. Also known as a Pomodoro clock, apparently!

## To-do

- setup basic components/layout with placeholder styling
- research & test methods for counting down in seconds
  - `setTimeout()` or `setInterval()` 1000ms???
- find a suitably annoying alarm sound (alarm woman from Last Crusade?)
- make it pretty
