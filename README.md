# 25 + 5 clock

My React-based app for the [Build a 25 + 5 Clock](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-25--5-clock) freeCodeCamp project. Also known as a Pomodoro clock, apparently!

## To-do

- look into replacing `setInterval()` with Accurate_Interval.js by Squuege
- display colour changes based on time left (eg <=60 secs)
- make it pretty
